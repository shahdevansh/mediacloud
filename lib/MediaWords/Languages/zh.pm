# Chinese version Functionalities
#
# 1. Word Segmenter For the word segmenter, I have used the Lingua::ZH::WordSegmenter module.
#    This class segment a Chinese sentences into words. I have modified the existing
#    MediaWords::StoryVectors module so that once the language of article is detected as Chinese,
#    word segmenter will be used to get a list of Chinese words.
#
# 2. Dictionary updating the word segmenter uses a dictionary stored in the folder lib/Lingua/ZH/.
#    One problem about the CPAN WordSegmenter module is that all the possible Chinese words are
#    refined by the dictionary. If some new words come into the language, the segmenter is not able
#    to detect. For example, foreign politicians' name might be separated into single characters.
#    To address this issue, I have written a method under the "script" folder, write_to_dict_ZH.
#    This method allows users to add a list of new words into the existing dictionary. Future work
#    could be down to automatically crawl a list of words on the websites, such as Wikipedia, to
#    add them into the dictionary.
#
# 3. Language Detection
#    In the module Lingua::ZH::MediaWords, there was a method to judge if a given text is Chinese.
#    If more than 25% of the characters are Chinese characters, the text will be processed as Chinese.
#    In this module, there are also methods to count Chinese characters and Latin letters.
#
# 4. Stop words
#    A list of 1600 stop words are selected from the most commonly used 6000 words from collected data.
#    These stop words are stored in the file MediaWords/Util/StopWords.pm.
#
# 5. Translation
#    The translate module is modified so that it automatically detects the source language and
#    translate it into English.  The module using Google Translate is utilized in this function.
#
# 6. Extractor
#    The Density function in MediaWords/Crawler/Extractor is modified to add into consideration that
#    Chinese sentences are generally shorter than English ones. Chinese characters are added more
#    weights in the calculation.
#    I have been working on this during summer 2010 under the framework of Google Summer of Code.
