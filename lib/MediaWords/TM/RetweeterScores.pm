#
# Generate retweet polarization scores for media within a topic.
#
# A retweet score is a ratio between -1.0 and 1.0 that compares the numbers of times any story within
# the media is shared by a user who has retweeted one of 2 groups of users.  So a retweet polarization
# score for the us presidential election twitter topic might measure the ratio for each media source of
# story shares by clinton vs. trump retweeters.
