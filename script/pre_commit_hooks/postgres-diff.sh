# Create a PostgreSQL diff between two SQL dumps before a SVN / Git commit.
#
# Usage:
# 1) Do some changes in Media Cloud's code under version control (SVN or Git) involving schema/mediawords.sql.
# 2) Run ./script/pre_commit_hooks/postgres-diff.sh before committing.
# 3) The script will print out SQL diff to STDOUT and (optionally) some warnings to STDERR.
