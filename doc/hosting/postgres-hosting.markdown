Postgres Notes
==============

Following are helpful notes for dealing with our local PostgreSQL setup.

Server
------

Our PostgreSQL server runs on mcdb1.  The  data is stored in /space/postresql.  The /space drive runs on an enclosure of
20 SSD drives (+ 2 warm spares in the enclosure) in RAID-10 via a PERC 810 card.

Backups
-------

The PostgreSQL databse is backed up weekly by running pg_dump on a harvard machine (faith.law.harvard.edu) over an ssh
tunneled connection to mcdb1.

Running Queries
---------------

To see a list of currently running queries on the server, run '/bin/pps' (for 'postgres ps'):

```
hroberts@mcdb1:~$ pps
  pid  |  usename   | state  |          query_start          |

 ```

`pps -l`  does not cut off each query at the wide of the terminal:

 ```
 #!/bin/bash
echo "select pid, usename, state, query_start, query from pg_stat_activity where state not like 'idle%' order by query_start desc" | psql mediacloud
```

cancel_pg_process()
-------------------

We have defined a function that runs with PostgreSQL superuser privileges that cancels any running PostgreSQL query.  So if
want to cancel the last query above, you run:

```
select cancel_pg_process( 13517 );
```

Blocking Queries
----------------

We try to avoid long transactions and locking wherever humanly possible in the codebase to avoid difficult to diagnose
blocking problems.  But we have a couple of views defined for cases in which you suspect blocking:

* blocking_tree - a query that returns in tree form blocked and blocking queries
* blocked_queries - a simple list of all queries that are currently blocked by some lock

For reasons that I don't understand, one of these queries will very occasionally returned blocked queries missed by
the other.

Object Size
-----------

Here's a query to return the size in GB of all objects in the database:

```
select p.relname, ( p.relpages * 8 ) / ( 1024 * 1024 ) from pg_class p order by p.relpages desc;
```

Here's a similar query for just indexes, which also displays read stats on each index (useful for finding big indexes
that we are not using):

```
SELECT p.relname, ( p.relpages * 8 ) / ( 1024 * 1024 ), i.idx_scan, i.idx_tup_read, i.idx_tup_fetch  FROM pg_class p, pg_stat_user_indexes i where i.indexrelname = p.relname ORDER BY relpages DESC;
```

postgres.conf
-------------

As of 20160315, here are the interesting parts of our postgresql.conf:

```
port = 5432				# (change requires restart)
max_connections = 300			# (change requires restart)
unix_socket_directories = '/var/run/postgresql'	# comma-separated list of directories
shared_buffers = 64GB			# min 128kB
temp_buffers = 128MB			# min 800kB
work_mem = 256MB				# min 64kB
maintenance_work_mem = 256MB		# min 1MB
vacuum_cost_delay = 0			# 0-100 milliseconds
vacuum_cost_limit = 10000		# 1-10000 credits
effective_io_concurrency = 20		# 1-1000; 0 disables prefetching
hot_standby = on			# "on" allows queries during recovery
hot_standby_feedback = on		# send info from standby to prevent
random_page_cost = 1.0			# same scale as above
effective_cache_size = 64GB
log_line_prefix = '%t [%p-%l] %q%u@%d '			# special values:

log_timezone = 'localtime'

datestyle = 'iso, mdy'
timezone = 'localtime'
lc_messages = 'en_US.UTF-8'			# locale for system error message
lc_monetary = 'en_US.UTF-8'			# locale for monetary formatting
lc_numeric = 'en_US.UTF-8'			# locale for number formatting
lc_time = 'en_US.UTF-8'				# locale for time formatting
